# Ansh & Riley Full-Stack Template

This is a full-stack template project for Software Composers to create  applications with AI.

## Getting started
To create a new project, you go to `/paths`, choose from our list of Paths, and then use Cursor's Composer feature to quickly scaffold your project!

You can also edit the Path's prompt template to be whatever you like!

## Technologies used
This doesn't really matter, but is useful for the AI to understand more about this project. We are using the following technologies
- React with Next.js 14 App Router
- TailwindCSS
- Firebase Auth, Storage, and Database
- Multiple AI endpoints including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Replicate using Vercel's AI SDK
=======
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
